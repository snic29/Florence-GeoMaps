# Florence-GeoMaps

This research project focuses on the integration of various sources (visual, spatial, liturgical, and both primary and secondary documents) to digitally reconstruct and explore medieval processions in Florence. The goal is to create a rich, interactive digital archive that allows users to discover and understand the religious and social significance of these events while also identifying the physical remnants of medieval Florence tied to them.

By combining historical records, artistic depictions, liturgical texts, and spatial data, the project creates detailed digital story maps that guide users through the locations and significance of processions that were central to medieval life. Themes explored include major events such as the Rogation Days Procession, which involved prayers for protection and divine intervention, and the role of fire and faith in Florence, particularly in relation to religious observances and public rituals.

The digital story maps offer a visual and spatial exploration of these events, helping users uncover the surviving physical traces of medieval processions. These interactive maps provide a detailed, layered approach to medieval Florence, making it possible for users to explore the city’s transformation from a religious and civic center to its present state.
